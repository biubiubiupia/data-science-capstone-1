# ðŸŽ§ Is there a connection between listening to music while working and our mental health?

For my capstone project in Data Science, I analyzed the results of an online survey that explored the respondents' music listening habits and self-reported mental health symptoms.

Although the behavioral data did not indicate strong correlations, I enjoyed learning Python and using Pandas and Bokeh to organize and visualize the data.

Some interesting insights from this dataset:
ðŸŽ¸ Rock and Metal shows the strongest positive correlation with Depression.
ðŸ¤  Country music shows a slight negative correlation with three mental health categories.
ðŸ’¼ Respondents who listen to music while working may report slightly higher OCD symptoms.

ðŸ‘€ I'm starting my unofficial survey hereâ€”what do you listen to while at work?
